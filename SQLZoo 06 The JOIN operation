The first example shows the goal scored by a player with the last name 'Bender'. 
The * says to list all the columns in the table - a shorter way of saying matchid, teamid, player, gtime
Modify it to show the matchid and player name for all goals scored by Germany. To identify German players, check for: teamid = 'GER'

SELECT matchid, player FROM goal 
  WHERE teamid LIKE 'GER'



show the player, teamid, stadium and mdate for every German goal.

SELECT player,teamid,stadium, mdate
  FROM game JOIN goal ON (game.id=goal.matchid) 
WHERE teamid LIKE 'GER'



Show player, teamid, coach, gtime for all goals scored in the first 10 minutes gtime<=10

SELECT player, teamid, coach, gtime
  FROM goal JOIN eteam ON (goal.teamid = eteam.id)
 WHERE gtime<=10



List the player for every goal scored in a game where the stadium was 'National Stadium, Warsaw'

SELECT player
FROM game JOIN goal ON (game.id = goal.matchid)
WHERE stadium LIKE 'National Stadium, Warsaw'



=======ADVANCED=======


show the name of all players who scored a goal against Germany (ever, i guess).

HINT
SELECT DISTINCT player
  FROM game JOIN goal ON matchid = id 
    WHERE (team1='GER' AND teamid <> 'GER') OR (team2='GER' AND teamid <> 'GER')



Show the stadium and the number of goals scored in each stadium.

SELECT stadium, COUNT(player)
FROM game JOIN goal ON game.id = goal.matchid
GROUP BY stadium
!!! Если мы делаем GROUP BY стадион, то весь запрос начинает рассматриваться как запрос по стадиону, 
то есть даже COUNT будет считать кол-во игроков на конкретном стадионе!!! (А игроков мы считаем,
потому что запись о каждом игроке означает гол в той таблице)



For every match involving 'POL', show the matchid, date and the number of goals scored.

SELECT matchid,mdate, COUNT(teamid)
  FROM game JOIN goal ON matchid = id 
 WHERE (team1 = 'POL' OR team2 = 'POL')
GROUP BY matchid



For every match where 'GER' scored, show matchid, match date and the number of goals scored by 'GER'

SELECT matchid, mdate, COUNT(player)
FROM game JOIN goal ON game.id = goal.matchid
WHERE teamid LIKE 'GER'
GROUP BY matchid



List every match with the goals scored by each team as shown. 
This will use "CASE WHEN" which has not been explained in any previous exercises.

SELECT mdate,
  team1,
  SUM(CASE WHEN teamid=team1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) score1, 
  team2,
  SUM(CASE WHEN teamid=team2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) score2
  FROM game JOIN goal ON matchid = id
GROUP BY matchid
ORDER BY mdate, matchid, team1, team2
