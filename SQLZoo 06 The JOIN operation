The first example shows the goal scored by a player with the last name 'Bender'. 
The * says to list all the columns in the table - a shorter way of saying matchid, teamid, player, gtime
Modify it to show the matchid and player name for all goals scored by Germany. To identify German players, check for: teamid = 'GER'

SELECT matchid, player FROM goal 
  WHERE teamid LIKE 'GER'



show the player, teamid, stadium and mdate for every German goal.

SELECT player,teamid,stadium, mdate
  FROM game JOIN goal ON (game.id=goal.matchid) 
WHERE teamid LIKE 'GER'



Show player, teamid, coach, gtime for all goals scored in the first 10 minutes gtime<=10

SELECT player, teamid, coach, gtime
  FROM goal JOIN eteam ON (goal.teamid = eteam.id)
 WHERE gtime<=10



List the player for every goal scored in a game where the stadium was 'National Stadium, Warsaw'

SELECT player
FROM game JOIN goal ON (game.id = goal.matchid)
WHERE stadium LIKE 'National Stadium, Warsaw'

show the name of all players who scored a goal against Germany (ever, i guess).

HINT
SELECT DISTINCT player
  FROM game JOIN goal ON matchid = id 
    WHERE (team1='GER' AND teamid <> 'GER') OR (team2='GER' AND teamid <> 'GER')
